# Tech Stack Components:
- Node.js: Runtime environment
- Express.js: Web server framework
- TypeScript: Language layer
- Axios: Directus API client
- Dotenv: Environment management
- Nodemon: Development reloading
- ts-node: TypeScript execution


This stack directly supports MCP's design goals of composability and isolation while providing the minimal necessary infrastructure for a Directus control plane. Each component was chosen to fulfill specific MCP server requirements without introducing unnecessary complexity.
