When creating project documentation, always adhere to the following guiding principles:

- When creating new documentation, be sure to first check the project documentation thoroughly before creating any new files. If a file exists that relates to the subject you're documenting, update the existing document before creating a new file.

- Changelogs should follow the formatting outlined by https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
