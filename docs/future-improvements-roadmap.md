## 7. Schema Management Enhancements

### Priority: High | Timeline: Next Release

- [x] **Hash-Validated Schema Operations**
  - ✅ Implement schema snapshot hash generation
  - ✅ Add schema diff generation
  - ✅ Create hash-validated schema apply mechanism
  
- [ ] **Schema Migration Tools**
  - [ ] Create schema version tracking
  - [ ] Implement schema migration scripts
  - [ ] Add rollback capability for migrations
  - [ ] Develop schema comparison tool between environments

- [ ] **Schema Synchronization**
  - [ ] Implement environment-to-environment schema sync
  - [ ] Add selective schema sync (specific collections/fields)
  - [ ] Create schema merge conflict resolution

- [ ] **Schema Optimization**
  - [ ] Add index recommendation tool
  - [ ] Implement field type optimization suggestions
  - [ ] Create performance analysis for schema design

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Focus first** on diagnostic capabilities and security enhancements
2. **Incrementally add** documentation improvements alongside feature development
3. **Prioritize** rollback capabilities for all schema-altering operations
4. **Schedule** performance optimizations after core functionality is robust
5. **Extend features** based on user feedback and Directus roadmap
6. **Continue improving** schema operation robustness with hash validation

## Progress Tracking

We will maintain a changelog in the project root to track progress on these initiatives. Each release will include a summary of completed items from this roadmap.
