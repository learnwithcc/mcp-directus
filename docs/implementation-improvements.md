# MCP Server Implementation Improvements

This document outlines the standardization patterns and robustness improvements implemented in the MCP server tools.

## Standardization Patterns

### 1. Common Tool Structure

All tools have been standardized to follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Initialization**: Create module-specific and operation-specific loggers
2. **Validation**: Validate all input parameters before execution
3. **Execution**: Perform the tool's core functionality with proper logging
4. **Response**: Return standardized response objects for both success and error cases

### 2. Standardized Response Format

All tools now return responses in a consistent format:

#### Success Response
```typescript
{
  status: 'success',
  message: 'Human-readable success message',
  details: {
    // Operation-specific details
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Error Response
```typescript
{
  status: 'error',
  message: 'Human-readable error message',
  details: {
    // Error-specific details including statusCode and errorDetails
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Each tool now includes:
- Module-level logger for static logging
- Operation-specific logger with contextual information
- Comprehensive logging throughout the operation lifecycle
- Detailed error logging with context

### 4. Input Validation

All tools now use a common validation system that:
- Verifies required parameters are present
- Validates parameter types
- Ensures strings are not empty when required
- Applies collection name validation
- Supports custom validation rules

## Transaction-like Rollback Mechanism

For complex operations that involve multiple API calls, we've implemented a transaction-like rollback mechanism:

1. **Resource Tracking**: All created resources are tracked during the operation
2. **Rollback Function**: A function to delete/revert created resources if an error occurs
3. **Clean Error Handling**: The rollback is automatically triggered on error

### Implemented in:
- `createOneToManyRelation.ts`
- `createManyToOneRelation.ts`
- `createOneToOneRelation.ts`
- `createManyToManyRelation.ts`

## Tools Updated with Standardized Patterns

### CRUD Operations
- ✅ `createItem.ts`: Create items in Directus collections
- ✅ `updateItem.ts`: Update existing items
- ✅ `deleteItem.ts`: Delete items from collections
- ✅ `getItem.ts`: Retrieve single items by ID
- ✅ `getItems.ts`: Retrieve multiple items with filtering
- ✅ `searchItems.ts`: Search for items across fields
- ✅ `uploadFile.ts`: Upload files with metadata

### Schema Operations
- ✅ `createCollection.ts`: Create new collections
- ✅ `createField.ts`: Add fields to collections
- ✅ `createRelation.ts`: Create relationships between collections

### Relationship Operations
- ✅ `createOneToManyRelation.ts`: Create one-to-many relationships with rollback
- ✅ `createManyToOneRelation.ts`: Create many-to-one relationships with rollback
- ✅ `createOneToOneRelation.ts`: Create one-to-one relationships with rollback
- ✅ `createManyToManyRelation.ts`: Create many-to-many relationships with rollback
- ✅ `createHashValidatedM2M.ts`: Create M2M relationships with hash validation

## Special Collection Handling

Tools have been enhanced to properly handle system collections:
- `directus_users`: Proper endpoint routing to `/users`
- `directus_files`: Proper endpoint routing to `/files`
- `directus_roles`: Proper endpoint routing to `/roles`

## Schema Operation Improvements

### Hash-Validated Schema Changes

We've implemented a robust approach to schema operations using hash validation:

- **Schema Snapshot Hash**: Generate a cryptographic hash of the current schema
- **Proper Diff Generation**: Generate schema differences before applying changes
- **Validated Schema Apply**: Apply changes with hash validation to ensure schema integrity
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry capability if schema changes between diff generation and application
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Direct API calls as a fallback when schema/apply endpoint is unavailable

### Idempotent Operations

Schema operations are now designed to be idempotent:
- Can be called multiple times safely
- Properly handle cases where entities already exist
- Provide warnings instead of errors for already-existing resources
- No duplicate entries created on retry

See the [Schema Operations](./schema-operations.md) document for more details.

## Error Handling Improvements

Error responses now include:
- Specific error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Original error details from Directus
- Suggestions for resolving common issues
- Context about the operation that failed

### Example: Permission Error Handling
```typescript
if (statusCode === 403) {
  errorMessage = `Permission denied. Ensure your token has appropriate permissions for "${collection}".`;
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Diagnostic Capabilities
- Expand the `diagnoseMCPPermissions.ts` tool to check for specific operations
- Add comprehensive connection tests beyond simple health checks
- Implement schema validation tests

### 2. Improve Documentation
- Add detailed comments to all tools
- Include usage examples
- Document error scenarios and troubleshooting guide
