## Building Directus Project with Updated Credentials (3/12/2025, 10:28:34 AM)

_**User**_

Now that the @.env has been updated with the correct creds for our dev Directus instance, let's go ahead and try building the project.

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user wants to build the Directus MCP server project now that the .env file has been updated with the correct credentials for their dev Directus instance. Let's check the current state of the project and see what we need to do to build it.

First, I should examine the project structure to understand what files we have and what might be missing.</think>I'll help you build the Directus MCP server project with the updated credentials. Let's first check the current project structure to understand what files we have and what we might need to add.

Let's look at the content of the package.json file to confirm the build scripts are properly set up:

Read file: undefined

Let's see what files we have in the src directory:

Now that I've examined the project structure, it looks like everything is in place for building the project. The package.json has the necessary build scripts, and we have the source files in the src directory. Let's go ahead and build the project:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run build
```

```
╭─     ~/dev/projects/mcp-directus     main ·········································· ✔  10:30:21   
╰─ npm ru
```

---

_****_

Let's complete the build command:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run build
```

```
❯ npm run build

> directus-mcp-server@1.0.0 build
> tsc

sh: tsc: command not found

```

---

_****_

It seems that the `tsc` command is not found. This usually happens when TypeScript is installed locally but not globally. Let's try installing the dependencies first:

---

_****_

```bash
npm install
```

```
❯ npm install

---

_****_

Great! All dependencies have been installed. Now let's try building the project again:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run build
```

```
❯ npm run build

> directus-mcp-server@1.0.0 build
> tsc



╭─     ~/dev/projects/mcp-directus     main !1 ?3 ···································· ✔  10:30:41   

```

Perfect! The build completed successfully. This means the TypeScript code has been compiled to JavaScript in the `dist` directory. Let's check if the dist directory was created and contains the compiled files:

Excellent! The build was successful and all the TypeScript files have been compiled to JavaScript in the dist directory.

Now that the build is complete, let's run the server to see if it can connect to your Directus instance:

---

_****_

```bash
npm start
```

---

_****_

Let's wait a moment for the server to start up, and then verify if it's running by checking the server logs:

---

```bash
ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep
```

```

Great! I can see that our server is running with the process ID 10078. Let's check if we can get any output from the server:

---

_****_

```bash
ps -f 10078
```

```
❯ ps -f 10078
  UID   PID  PPID   C STIME   TTY           TIME CMD

╰─
```

---

_****_

Let's try running in the foreground to see the server output:

---

_****_

```bash
pkill -f "node dist/index.js"
```

```
❯ pkill -f "node dist/index.js"


╭─     ~/dev/projects/mcp-directus     main !1 ?3 ···································· ✔  10:31:09   
╰─
```

---

_****_

Now let's run the server in the foreground to see the output:

---

_****_

```bash
npm start
```

```
❯ npm start

> directus-mcp-server@1.0.0 start
> node dist/index.js

Directus MCP server running at http://localhost:3000
```

---

_****_

Great! The server is now running and listening at http://localhost:3000. We've successfully:

1. Installed all the required dependencies
2. Built the TypeScript project
3. Started the MCP server with the updated credentials from the .env file

The output `Directus MCP server running at http://localhost:3000` confirms that the server is running correctly.

Let's test if the server is properly connected to your Directus instance by making a request to the `/mcp/v1/tools` endpoint, which should list all available tools:

---

_****_

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/mcp/v1/tools | jq
```

```

Let's try that again with the full command:

Excellent! The MCP server is running successfully and correctly lists all available tools as defined in the implementation. This confirms that your server is working as expected and is ready to handle requests.

Let's test one of the basic tools to verify the connection to your Directus instance. Let's try the `getItems` tool to get users from the Directus instance:

---

_****_

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"collection": "directus_users", "query": {"limit": 3}}' http://localhost:3000/mcp/v1/tools/getItems | jq
```

```

It seems we're getting an error when trying to invoke the getItems tool. Let's check the server logs to see if there's any more information:

---

_****_

```bash
cat ~/.pm2/logs/directus-mcp-server-error.log | tail -n 20 2>/dev/null || echo "No PM2 logs found"
```

```

---

_****_

Let's check if there's any output from our running server process:

---

_****_

```bash
ps -ef | grep node | grep dist/index
```

```
❯ ps -ef | grep node | grep dist/index

```

---

_****_

Let's try stopping the current server and running it in a way that we can see the error logs:

---

_****_

```bash
pkill -f "node dist/index.js"
```

```
❯ pkill -f "node dist/index.js"

```

---

_****_

Now let's run the server with more verbose output for debugging:

---

_****_

```bash
NODE_DEBUG=http,net node dist/index.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

```


╭─     ~/dev/projects/mcp-directus     main !1 ?3 ···································· ✔  10:32:44   

Great! The server is running in the background with debug output directed to server.log. Let's try our API request again:

Let's see more of the log to get the actual error:

Now we can see the issue - we're getting a 403 Forbidden error from the Directus API. This indicates there's an issue with the authentication token provided in the .env file.

Let's check if we can access the Directus API directly to verify if the token is working:

Great! The token is working correctly when accessing the Directus API directly. The issue might be with how our MCP server is constructing the API requests. Let's check the implementation of the getItems function:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Let's also check how the Directus client is being initialized:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Let's also check the index.ts file to see how the server is being initialized:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see the issue. The problem is that our direct curl request to Directus is using the correct endpoint structure (`/users`), but our MCP server is using `/items/directus_users`. Let's modify our curl request to match the endpoint structure used by our MCP server:

---

_****_

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sAkELUjsqTu4J3qg0FyI_7mFnV9BPX8a" http://localhost:8077/items/directus_users?limit=1 | jq
```

```

      }
    }
  ]
}

╰─
```

---

_****_

Now we can see the issue more clearly. The token we're using doesn't have permission to access the `directus_users` collection through the `/items/directus_users` endpoint. This is a common security restriction in Directus - the admin token might have access to the `/users` endpoint but not to the raw collection via `/items/directus_users`.

Let's try a different approach. Let's modify our test to use a collection that might be more accessible, or try to use the correct endpoint for users:

---

_****_

```diff
    const fn = async ({ collection, query = {} }: { collection: string; query?: Record<string, any> }) => {
      try {
-       const response = await directusClient.get(`/items/${collection}`, { params: query });
-       return response.data.data;
+       // Handle special system collections
+       if (collection === 'directus_users') {
+         const response = await directusClient.get('/users', { params: query });
+         return response.data.data;
+       } else if (collection === 'directus_files') {
+         const response = await directusClient.get('/files', { params: query });
+         return response.data.data;
+       } else if (collection === 'directus_roles') {
+         const response = await directusClient.get('/roles', { params: query });
+         return response.data.data;
+       } else {
+         // Standard collection
+         const response = await directusClient.get(`/items/${collection}`, { params: query });
+         return response.data.data;
+       }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting items:', error);
```

---

_****_

Now let's also update the getItem.ts file to handle special collections:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Let's update the getItem function as well:

---

_****_

```diff
    const fn = async ({ collection, id }: { collection: string; id: string }) => {
      try {
-       const response = await directusClient.get(`/items/${collection}/${id}`);
-       return response.data.data;
+       // Handle special system collections
+       if (collection === 'directus_users') {
+         const response = await directusClient.get(`/users/${id}`);
+         return response.data.data;
+       } else if (collection === 'directus_files') {
+         const response = await directusClient.get(`/files/${id}`);
+         return response.data.data;
+       } else if (collection === 'directus_roles') {
+         const response = await directusClient.get(`/roles/${id}`);
+         return response.data.data;
+       } else {
+         // Standard collection
+         const response = await directusClient.get(`/items/${collection}/${id}`);
+         return response.data.data;
+       }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting item:', error);
```

---

_****_

Now let's rebuild the project and restart the server:

---

_****_

```bash
pkill -f "node dist/index.js" && npm run build
```

```

Excellent! Our MCP server is now successfully connecting to the Directus instance and retrieving data. The changes we made to handle special system collections like `directus_users` by using the appropriate endpoints have fixed the issue.

Let's try one more test with a different tool, like getItem, to make sure everything is working correctly:

---

_****_

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"collection": "directus_users", "id": "7a6819b5-900f-48cb-8eb1-724b5a1ba596"}' http://localhost:3000/mcp/v1/tools/getItem | jq

Perfect! Both the getItems and getItem tools are now working correctly with the Directus instance. We've successfully:

1. Built the TypeScript project
2. Identified and fixed an issue with how the MCP server was accessing system collections
3. Verified that the server can now successfully connect to and retrieve data from the Directus instance

The MCP server is now up and running, connected to your Directus instance at http://localhost:8077 using the admin token provided in the .env file. The server is listening at http://localhost:3000 and can be used by AI clients to interact with your Directus instance.

Here's a summary of what we did:

1. We installed all the required dependencies using `npm install`
2. We built the TypeScript project using `npm run build`
3. We identified an issue with how the MCP server was accessing system collections like `directus_users`
4. We updated the getItems and getItem functions to handle special system collections by using the appropriate endpoints
5. We rebuilt and restarted the server
6. We verified that the server is now working correctly by testing the getItems and getItem tools

Is there anything else you'd like to do with the MCP server or any other tools you'd like to test?

Please create an example json config for quick setup with Claude Desktop.

Then, create a README.md detailing the project and how to use it.

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is asking for two things:
1. An example JSON config file for quick setup with Claude Desktop
2. A README.md file detailing the project and how to use it

For the Claude Desktop config, I need to create a JSON file that defines the MCP server configuration. Based on the MCP specification documentation provided, this should include the URL of our MCP server and a description.

For the README.md, I'll need to create a comprehensive guide that explains:
- What the project is (Directus MCP Server)
- How to set it up
- How to use it
- Available tools and functionalities
- How to connect it to Claude Desktop or other AI clients

Let me start with the Claude Desktop config file and then create the README.md.</think>I'll create both files for you - first an example JSON config for Claude Desktop setup, followed by a comprehensive README.md for the project.

Let's start with the Claude Desktop configuration file:
